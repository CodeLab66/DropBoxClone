# DropBoxClone

This repository is a project aimed at creating a simplified clone of the popular cloud storage service, Dropbox.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **File Storage:** Basic functionality for storing and retrieving files.
*   **File Synchronization:** Mimics the core Dropbox feature of syncing files between a local machine and a remote server. (Implementation details may vary)
*   **C Language Implementation:** Demonstrates file system interaction and networking concepts using the C programming language.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

*   **C Compiler:**  GCC or Clang (required for compiling the source code).
*   **CMake:** (Optional, but recommended) A cross-platform build system generator.
*   **Standard C Libraries:** The standard C libraries are required.
*   **Networking Libraries:** Libraries for network communication (e.g., sockets). Specific library details depend on the networking implementation.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the DropBoxClone project:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CodeLab66/DropBoxClone.git
    cd DropBoxClone
    ```

2.  **Build the Project (Using CMake - Recommended):**

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

    *Alternatively (if not using CMake):*

    Consult the `CMakeLists.txt` file or other build instructions to understand the necessary compilation commands.  You might need to manually compile the source files using `gcc` or another C compiler.

3.  **Configure the Client and Server (If applicable):**

    The project likely contains client and server components.  Refer to the source code and related documentation (if available) to understand how to configure the connection parameters (e.g., server address, port number).

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

Due to the lack of detailed documentation in the repository, the best way to understand usage is to examine the source code directly.  Look for entry point functions (`main()`) in the client and server components.

**API Documentation:**

No formal API documentation is available at this time. Inspect the source code, specifically function definitions, to understand the interactions between modules.

## Configuration Options

The project's behavior can likely be configured through command-line arguments, configuration files, or environment variables. Check the source code for any parsing of such options.

Common configuration options may include:

*   **Server Address:** The IP address or hostname of the server.
*   **Port Number:** The port number used for communication between the client and the server.
*   **Local Storage Directory:** The directory on the client's machine where files are stored.
*   **Logging Level:** Controls the verbosity of logging output.
